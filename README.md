# The importance of the data.

## Explain the impact of the data today:
The study of data has radically impacted the solution of problems in different branches of the time, Because thanks 
to them many discoveries have been made and better decisions have been made.

## Explain the reasons why data generation has increased.
The increase is due to the fact that decisions are no longer taken lightly, before making a decision a 
probabilistic study is carried out through technological tools of a set of data collected about a problem, in 
order to have a better solution or decision.

# Fundamentals of Big Data. 

## Define the Big Data concept:
It is a term that describes the large volume of data, both structured and unstructured, that flood a 
company on a day-to-day basis.

## Differentiate between open data and private data:
Open data is data that is available to everyone, without restrictions or anything.
Private data is the opposite of open data, since they need permits or certificates to use
them and are used exclusively by the different companies that collect them.

## Differentiate between structured and unstructured data:
Structured data is data that can be sorted and displayed in rows and columns so that any data analysis
administrator can easily process it.
Unstructured data is generally binary data that does not have an identifiable internal structure. In other words, they are data that still cannot be analyzed to reach a conclusion and / or solution.

## Differentiate between stored data and moving data:
Moving data is data that is transmitted in real time on a network. Something like dynamic data.
The data stored as the name implies, are data that different pages, companies and organizations collect from the 
registration and backup systems and are stored for use at any time and their analysis in different applications 
through APIS or some type of Carry This data elsewhere.

# Fundamentals of data analysis.

## Define the meaning of data analysis:
Data analysis is a process that involves inspecting, cleaning and transforming data to highlight useful
information, suggest conclusions and support in decision making.

## Explain the impact of data analysis on organizations:
In organizations the impact of data analysis has been very large, and one could say that it is 
currently the most important because it is the basis of all the achievements, the basis of the decision-making 
that is made, etc.

## Explain the different types of data analysis:
1. Descriptive Analytics:
It consists of simplifying and summarizing the data in small packages, so that they become more manageable.
2. Predictive Analytics:
Predictive analytics is the technique that allows analysts to make predictions based on probability.
3. Prescriptive analysis:
Suggests the possible decisions to be taken against these scenarios, and the probable consequences of those decisions.

## Handoop 
Is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. Is a library.

## MapReduce
Map Reduce is a programming environmentconsists of distributing a large amount of data in many clusters and processing them faster.

## Apache Spark
Spark is a distributed data processing engine that allows you to handle large volumes of information.

## Lambda Y Kappa

Lambda: This architecture is characterized by using different layers for batch processing and streaming.

Kappa: Unlike lambda, his proposal is to eliminate the batch layer leaving only the streaming layer.

# GitHub Commands

Git Init: Turn an existing directory into a git repository
```github
Git Init  
```
Git Commit -m "Message": Records file snapshots permanently in version history
```github
Git Commit -m Myfile.txt
```
Git reset: Undoes all commits after [commit], preserving changes locally
```github
Git reset
```
Git log: Lists version history for the current branch
```github
Git log
```
Git Status: Check the files that don't are agregate in commit. 
Show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit
```github
Git Status
```
Git add "File.txt": add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage)
```github
Git add "MyFile.txt"
```
Git rm: This command delete the file from project and stage the removal for commit
```github
Git rm MyFile.txt
```
Git mv : Change an existing file path and stage the move.
```github
git mv [existing-path] [new-path]
```

Git diff: show the diff of changes of a file before to apply commit
```github
git diff [existing-path] [new-path]
```
Git checkout: switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory
```github
git checkout xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
Git reset: Unstage a file while retaining the changes in working directory
```github
git reset File.txt
```
Git ammend: It is a practical way to modify the most recent confirmation. It allows you to combine the changes prepared with the previous confirmation instead of creating a new confirmation.
```github
git commit --amend
```
